🔹 "About me"

Hello! I'm a Telegram developer on aiogram 3, I make bots from scratch for any tasks. Now I'm just entering the order market - I already know how to make stable bots with strict typing, with a database on SQLAlchemy, with a basket, admin and orders. The code style is clean, with annotations and asynchronous functions. The code is easy to maintain and develop. I work fast, I don't get lost and always finish the details.

🔹 Skills • ✅ aiogram 3 (current architecture) • ✅ DB: SQLAlchemy + aiosqlite • ✅ Strict typing, async functions, builder keyboards • ✅ Shopping cart and ordering without FSM • ✅ Inline buttons, parsing, notifications to admins

💬 Individual tasks are discussed - write to my mail 👉 zackirov.abdurahmon@yandex.com and I will tell you how much and for how much.

🔹 Structure of my demo bot:

🛠 Developed in my style: builder keyboards, pure asynchronous code.
