👋 Hey there, I’m Abdurahmon Zakirov

🐍 About Me

I’m a developer who has taken Aiogram 3 to the next level.

For me, Telegram bots are not just side        projects — they are full-scale, production- ready solutions that can:

 • 🤖 Automate workflows.

 • 🌍 Engage thousands of users.

 • 💼 Bring real value to businesses and communities.

⚡ What I Do

 • 💻 Build fast, reliable, and scalable bots.

 • 🔗 Seamlessly integrate with APIs, databases, and third-party services.

 • 🧩 Design advanced FSM logic, custom filters, and middlewares.

 • 🏗 Create bots with clean architecture and professional polish.

 • 🚀 Push the limits of what Telegram bots can do.

🎯 My Vision

I don’t just write code — I craft experiences.
From lightweight assistants to complex ecosystems with analytics and integrations, my goal is to make every project feel powerful, efficient, and future-ready.
